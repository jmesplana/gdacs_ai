# Disaster, Conflict, and Operational Prioritization Platform

**Live Demo:** [https://disasters.aidstack.ai](https://disasters.aidstack.ai)

A web-based humanitarian operations workspace for combining **GDACS disasters**, **ACLED conflict data**, **administrative boundaries**, **facility datasets**, **WorldPop population layers**, and **OSM infrastructure** into one scoped operational view. The platform supports impact assessment, operational viability, logistics analysis, forward-looking outlooks, situation reporting, and ranked action prioritization.

---

## Overview

This application is built for responders who need to answer a practical question quickly:

**What is happening in the area we care about, who is exposed, what access still works, and what should we do next?**

The app is designed around an area-based workflow:

1. Load a shapefile or GeoJSON boundary for the operational geography.
2. Upload facilities and optional ACLED data.
3. Filter to the district or admin area that matters for the response.
4. Enrich that area with WorldPop and OSM infrastructure.
5. Run analysis tools on the scoped area rather than on all global events.

This keeps global GDACS alerts useful for awareness while letting operations stay focused on a specific response geography.

## Core Capabilities

### Mapping and data layers
- GDACS disaster alerts with polygons and impact zones
- ACLED conflict event overlays with filtering by event type and recency
- Uploaded administrative boundaries from shapefiles or GeoJSON
- Uploaded facilities or sites from CSV
- Heatmap and timeline playback for disaster and conflict activity
- Drawing and annotation tools for routes, zones, and operational notes
- Street, satellite, and terrain base maps

### Operational analysis
- Facility impact assessment against GDACS disasters and optional ACLED events
- District-level risk scoring from disaster and conflict context
- Facility-level AI analysis and recommendations
- Operation-specific viability scoring for immunization, malaria, WASH, nutrition, medical supply, shelter, and general humanitarian operations
- Security assessment with ACLED-aware movement considerations
- Logistics assessment using OSM roads, bridges, airports, fuel, and other infrastructure
- Forward-looking operational outlooks and predictive dashboards
- Situation report generation and exportable decision briefs
- Scoped prioritization board for ranking actions inside selected admin areas

### Enrichment layers
- WorldPop population statistics and age-sex breakdowns through Google Earth Engine
- OSM selective infrastructure loading for chosen admin areas and categories
- Weather-aware analysis and forecast context
- AI chat with current workspace context, including districts, facilities, disasters, ACLED, WorldPop, weather, and OSM when available

---

## What Has Been Added

Compared with the earlier GDACS-focused tool, the current app includes:

- ACLED upload, filtering, and map visualization
- District/admin boundary upload and district-level risk analysis
- WorldPop integration via Google Earth Engine
- Selective OSM infrastructure loading by admin area and category
- Logistics assessment with confidence and infrastructure coverage indicators
- Operation-specific viability APIs and dashboards
- Prediction dashboard for disaster, outbreak, and supply-chain risk
- Operational Outlook for scenario-based forward planning
- SitRep generation and decision-brief export APIs
- Prioritization Board for ranked next actions in a scoped response area
- Shared area-based workflow so WorldPop, OSM, and prioritization all depend on the same selected operational geography

---

## Prioritization Board

The Prioritization Board is a modular feature with its own endpoint:

- UI component: `components/PrioritizationBoard.js`
- API endpoint: `pages/api/prioritization-board.js`
- Scoring logic: `lib/prioritizationBoard.js`

### How it works

The board is intentionally **not global**. It does not rank all facilities against all worldwide GDACS events.

It requires:
- uploaded administrative boundaries
- a selected admin area / analysis area

It then ranks only the data inside that selected geography:
- facilities in the selected area
- disasters in the selected area
- ACLED events in the selected area, if available
- WorldPop context for the selected area, if available
- OSM context for the selected area, if available

### Confidence model

The board still runs when some enrichment layers are missing:

- ACLED is optional
- WorldPop is optional
- OSM is optional

When those layers are missing, the board shows lower-confidence / missing-signal context rather than blocking execution.

---

## Supported Workflows

### 1. Immunization campaign planning
- Upload vaccination sites or campaign locations as facilities
- Upload admin boundaries to define the operational geography
- Optionally upload ACLED to understand security constraints
- Load WorldPop to estimate exposed and underserved populations
- Use operation viability, outlook, and prioritization to decide where to go now, where to delay, and where to pre-position

### 2. Humanitarian access and logistics
- Upload offices, warehouses, or distribution points
- Select target admin areas
- Load OSM infrastructure only for those admin areas
- Run logistics assessment to review roads, bridges, fuel, airports, and security context
- Use the prioritization board to rank where teams should assess or move first

### 3. Outbreak and WASH response
- Upload case or intervention sites as facilities
- Use district boundaries to define the analysis area
- Load WorldPop for population exposure and demographic context
- Combine flood/disaster context with WASH and health datasets
- Use the outlook and forecast tools for forward planning

### 4. Multi-sector operational planning
- Combine facilities from health, WASH, education, shelter, or logistics
- Filter to the actual operational geography
- Use ACLED, GDACS, WorldPop, and OSM as layered context
- Generate SitReps, decision briefs, and ranked operational actions

## Data Inputs

### GDACS
- Automatically loaded disaster alerts
- Used for map visualization, facility impact assessment, forecasting context, and district risk scoring

### ACLED
- Upload CSV exports from ACLED
- Used for security overlays, district risk scoring, viability logic, logistics context, and prioritization when present
- ACLED data is not persisted in browser cache due to file size constraints

### Administrative boundaries
- Upload shapefiles (`.zip`) or GeoJSON
- Used to scope analysis to actual response geographies
- Required for WorldPop, OSM area loading, district-level analysis, and the Prioritization Board

### Facilities
- Upload any CSV with at least:
  - `name`
  - `latitude`
  - `longitude`
- Additional columns can be used by AI analysis and operational logic

### WorldPop
- Pulled through Google Earth Engine after districts are loaded
- Supports total population and age-sex analysis
- Intended to be used on uploaded district geometries, not on arbitrary global map extents

### OSM infrastructure
- Loaded only for selected admin areas
- Categories include hospitals, schools, roads, bridges, water, power, fuel, pharmacies, and airports
- Used in logistics assessment and other operational context layers

---

## Typical User Flow

### Step 1: Load the operational geography
1. Upload a shapefile or GeoJSON admin boundary

## Deployment Notes

The app is designed to run well on **Vercel** using Next.js API routes.

Important considerations:
- OpenAI-backed APIs run server-side through Vercel functions
- WorldPop requires `GEE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` to be configured in Vercel environment variables
- OSM infrastructure loading is area-scoped to reduce request size and keep responses practical for serverless deployment
- ACLED uploads can be large and are intentionally not browser-cached
- The Prioritization Board endpoint is lightweight because it scores already-scoped client state rather than querying global datasets directly

---

## Example Facility CSV

```csv
name,latitude,longitude,population,coverage_rate,cases,facility_type,partner
District A Clinic,1.234,32.567,50000,90,3,clinic,UNICEF
