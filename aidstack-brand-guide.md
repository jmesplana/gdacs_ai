## Voice & Tone

### Brand Voice Attributes
**Who we are:**
- **Expert, not academic**: We know the sector deeply but speak plainly
- **Urgent, not alarmist**: We respect the gravity of the work without dramatizing
- **Empowering, not paternalistic**: We support professionals, not rescue them
- **Human, not corporate**: We're people building tools for people

### Writing Principles

#### 1. Be Direct
❌ "Our innovative suite of solutions leverages cutting-edge AI to facilitate..."  
✅ "AI tools that help you write proposals, analyze data, and track outbreaks."

#### 2. Respect Expertise
❌ "Aid work is hard! Let us save you!"  
✅ "You know the field. We know AI. Together, let's save time on admin so you can focus on impact."

#### 3. Use Sector Language (But Explain Acronyms First)
✅ "Track CERF deadlines, monitor SPHERE compliance, integrate with DHIS2"
✅ "Track CERF (Central Emergency Response Fund) deadlines..."

#### 4. Show, Don't Tell
❌ "Revolutionary AI platform"  
✅ "Analyze 10,000 patient records in minutes, not days"

#### 5. Acknowledge Constraints
✅ "Works offline-first for field contexts"  
✅ "Free for local NGOs, tiered pricing for INGOs"

### Tone by Context

**Marketing Website**: Confident, inspiring, clear  
*"Intelligence infrastructure for people who save lives."*

**Product Interface**: Helpful, efficient, non-intrusive  
*"Upload your data. We'll find the patterns."*

**Documentation**: Precise, thorough, example-rich  
*"To connect your DHIS2 instance, you'll need..."*

**Error Messages**: Honest, actionable, calm  
*"This file format isn't supported yet. Try CSV or XLSX instead."*

**Sales/Partnerships**: Collaborative, sector-aware, realistic  
*"We integrate with the tools you already use: DHIS2, Kobo Toolbox, CommCare."*

### Words We Use
- Professionals, workers, practitioners (not "users")
- Tools, intelligence, infrastructure (not "solutions")
- Impact, lives, communities (not "outcomes")
- Field, front lines, crisis contexts (not "end users")
- Open, transparent, ethical (not "innovative")

### Words We Avoid
- Disruption, revolution, game-changer
- Synergy, leverage, facilitate
- Empower (overused in development)
- Save the world (paternalistic)
- Bleeding edge, next-gen (buzzwords)
