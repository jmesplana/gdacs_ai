# GDACS Facilities AI - Future Improvements

## Implemented Enhancements
- Added support for GDACS CAP XML format
- Implemented polygon rendering for affected areas
- Added CAP-specific filters (severity, certainty, urgency)
- Fixed date filter functionality
- Added coordinate format auto-detection and correction

## Recommended Future Improvements

### Caching and Performance
- Implement a caching mechanism for the GDACS data to reduce API calls
- Add a "last updated" indicator to show data freshness
- Lazy-load data for filters that aren't visible to improve initial load time

### Error Handling and Resilience
- Add better fallback strategies when the API fails
- Implement retry logic for API calls with exponential backoff
- Add clearer error messages to users when data can't be loaded

### User Interface Enhancements
- Add a heatmap visualization option for areas with multiple disasters
- Implement zoom-to-fit for filtered events
- Add timeline visualization of disaster progression
- Improve mobile responsiveness of the filter drawers
- Add a legend explaining polygon vs. circle indicators

### Data Integration
- Integrate additional data sources beyond GDACS
- Add historical data comparison
- Implement cross-referencing between different disaster types in the same region

### Analysis and Reporting
- Enhance the impact assessment calculations using polygon data
- Add statistical summaries of affected areas
- Implement reporting on overlapping disasters
- Add the ability to export custom reports in multiple formats

### Code Structure
- Split the large MapComponent into smaller, more manageable components
- Implement proper state management (Redux/Context) instead of prop drilling
- Add comprehensive TypeScript typing
- Create reusable filter components to reduce code duplication

### Testing and Quality
- Add unit tests for critical functionality like coordinate processing
- Implement E2E tests for user workflows
- Add continuous integration for automated testing
- Add performance benchmarking

### Features for Disaster Response
- Add routing capabilities to calculate evacuation routes
- Implement facility capacity analysis for emergency planning
- Add real-time monitoring notifications
- Integrate weather forecast data for predictive warnings
