# Contributing workspace apps

For **uploadable apps that install without a platform rebuild**, use
`templates/installable-app/README.md`. Workspace apps now provides Add app and
a downloadable example ZIP. The instructions below describe the separate
bundled source-module workflow.

Workspace apps are reviewed React modules with a manifest.json, index.js default
component export, and README.md. The store currently enables bundled modules in
each browser workspace. Packages are source contributions, not remotely loaded
executables. No publishing service or server database is required for this stage.

## Create and register

1. Copy templates/workspace-app to components/apps/your-app-id.
2. Set a unique manifest id, name, description, author, major.minor.patch version,
   platformApiVersion (currently 1), requiredData and capabilities.
3. Import your manifest in lib/platform/appRegistry.js and add it to defineAppRegistry.
4. Add its ID and literal dynamic import in components/platform/appComponents.js.
   Follow immunization's example. No changes to AppHub are needed.
5. Run `npm run app:validate -- components/apps/your-app-id`, `npm test`, and
   `npm run build`. Test installation, opening, saving, reopening, disabling and
   workspace isolation in the browser.

## Host API

The host passes workspaceId and a leaveGuard ref. Apps with read:boundaries get
districts, and apps with read:sites get facilities; otherwise these are empty
arrays. write:plans provides storage. export:plans declares export behavior.
Required data accepts administrative-boundaries and facilities. Missing data
blocks installation/opening but never prevents disabling an installed app.

Set leaveGuard.current to a synchronous function returning whether navigation
may proceed, and clear it on unmount. Apps with unsaved data should also handle
beforeunload. The host remounts apps on workspace changes and catches render errors.

These declarations govern host props; they are not a security boundary. Bundled
modules execute trusted JavaScript on the platform origin. External executable
apps need an isolated runtime and enforced API access before upload/install can
be offered. Module dependencies and backend extensions are not supported yet.

## Storage

Use await storage.listPlans(), storage.loadPlan(id), and
storage.savePlan(plan, expectedRevision = 0). A record needs a non-empty string id
and metadata.name string. Storage supplies moduleId, workspaceId, revision and
savedAt. Pass the saved revision on updates. Conflicting revisions or scope fields
reject. Missing records return undefined. Domain validation belongs to the app.

Records, summaries and revision history are saved atomically. IDs are independent
between modules and workspaces. Data stays in IndexedDB on this browser/origin.
Disabling retains records. Legacy immunization plans and history migrate on first
open; close older tabs if they block the database upgrade. Server storage can
later implement the same contract through createModuleStorage's adapter argument.

## Submit and release

Run `npm run app:validate -- components/apps/your-app-id --pack` to produce a ZIP
under build/app-packages. This validates metadata and required files, not code
correctness or security. Existing archives are not overwritten. Review archive
contents before sharing; never include secrets or operational data.

Submit a pull request with the source directory, registration changes, tests,
and documentation of platform helpers or additional dependencies used. A reviewer
checks the declared data access, data handling, compatibility, migrations and UI.
After review, the maintainer merges and deploys the platform release. The module
then appears in Workspace apps. This workflow does not publish automatically.

Keep module IDs stable across updates so saved records remain accessible. Version
your record schema separately and migrate older records in the module. Current
installations track enabled IDs; code versions follow the platform release.
Independent version selection, remote package installation and automatic rollback
are future runtime work, not features of this source package format.
